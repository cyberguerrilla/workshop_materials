Docker Aliases:

	Docker isn't hard, but it is hard to learn when you're trying to wrap your head around ELK...

	So we aliased a few commands to make your life easier.
	If you'd like to see what these are actually doing, just cat the .bashrc file for either the analyst account, or the root account.


	List all Docker containers and view their state (running, exited, etc):
	$ containers


	Get a shell on one of the running containers:
	$ <container-name>

		e.g.:
			$ es01
			$ logstash
			$ kibana


	Start a single container:
	$ start-<container-name>

		e.g.:
			$ start-es01
			$ start-logstash
			$ start-kibana


	Stop a single container:
	$ stop-<container-name>

		e.g.:
			$ stop-es01
			$ stop-logstash
			$ stop-kibana


	Start all ELK containers:
	$ start-elk


	Stop all ELK containers:
	$ stop-elk


	Start all osquery (Kolide Fleet) containers:
	$ start-osquery


	Stop all osquery (Kolide Fleet) containers:
	$ stop-osquery
